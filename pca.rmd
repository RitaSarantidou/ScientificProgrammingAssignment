PCA analysis and visualization.

Since an eigenvalue <1 would mean that the component actually explains less than a single explanatory variable we would like to discard those.
If our data is well suited for PCA we should be able to discard these components while retaining at least 70â€“80% of cumulative variance.

```{r}
ddf <- knnImputation(df, k = 5, scale = T)  # imputing NAs
anyNA(ddf)
ddf <- ddf[,5:47287]

ddf.pca <- prcomp(ddf, center = T, scale = T)
summary(ddf.pca)

eigen <- ddf.pca$sdev^2  # by squaring the eigenvalues we get the variance explained by each PC

perc_variance<- as.vector(eigen/sum(eigen)*100)

plot(cumsum(ddf.pca$sdev^2/sum(ddf.pca$sdev^2)), xlab = "PC #", ylab = "Amount of explained variance", main = "Cumulative variance plot") # plot cumulative explained variance
abline(v = 370, col="blue", lty=5)
abline(h = 0.80, col="blue", lty=5)
legend("topleft", legend=c("Cut-off @ PC370"),
       col=c("blue"), lty=5, cex=0.6)

# screeplot(ddf.pca, type = "l", npcs = 500, main = "Screeplot of the first 400 PCs")
# abline(h = 1, col="red", lty=5)
# legend("topright", legend=c("Eigenvalue = 1"),
#        col=c("red"), lty=5, cex=0.6)

```
